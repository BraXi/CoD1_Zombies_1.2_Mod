# BraXi's Zombies Mod v1.2 for CoD 1 
The complete source code of the second revision of CoD1 Zombies Mod created almost solely by BraXi

Do whatever you want with it, but don't remove this file and keep authors of the mod,
they need some respect for sharing their work. Feel free to modify assets in this mod.

Mod works only with CoD1 1.5 but some people reported success running it on version 1.4 aswell.
I've finished this mod in 20.07.2010 and it's the mod I'm the most proud of (probably because I love zombies, but who cares?).

# What are those directories all about:
* /client - source files of the client-side assets
* /server - source files of the server-side scripts
* /release_paks - a pre-built .pk3 files to use on your server

# To host your own server you'll need BOTH client and server files installed on server


[more instructions will be posted here soon]
